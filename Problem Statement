Studies have proved that wearing a face mask significantly reduces the risk of viral transmission as well as provides a sense of protection. However, it is not feasible to manually track the implementation of this policy.We introduce a Deep Learning based system that can detect instances where face masks are not used properly. Our system consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture capable of detecting masked and unmasked faces.This will help track safety violations, promote the use of face masks, and ensure a safe working environment.
